## Description:

A program that implements a maze solving algorithm using a stack or queue.
The maze solution is shown by highlighting the tiles checked by the algorithm
using either a stack or a queue for storing the tiles already seen. The darker the tile,
the more times the algorithm stored that particular tile in memory.
There is an additional readme with the original assignment instructions.

The file is called _README.pdf_.
